Is there any coorelation between the existence of bike infrastructure and the frequency of accidents? We decided to perform a case study on bike accidents Philidelphia. We will compare two datasets, one detailing the location of accidents involving cyclists and the other dataset which details the type of bike infrastructure in place based on location. 

Datasets: 
https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/bike-network 
https://data.philly.com/datasets/crashes/pedestrian_bicyclist/?cType=fm  

We will be using a relational database and using SQL to combine the two databases. 

### Extraction
We used data from two datasets, 1 detailing information regarding Philidelphia's bike infrastructure based on location, and the other dataset detailing bike accident information throughout Philidelphia. We will refer to these datasets as D1 and D2 respectively. 

Extract: indicates the original
data sources and how the data
were formatted at a professional
level
√ Transform: explains what data
clearing or transformation was
required at a professional level
√ Load: explains the final
database, tables/collections, and
why the topic was chosen at a
